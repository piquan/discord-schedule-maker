# Discord Schedule Maker

Welcome to the Discord Schedule Maker! This easy-to-use web app lets you create event schedules formatted specifically for Discord. Post your schedule in any Discord channel, and each event's date and time will automatically adjust to the viewer's local timezone. It's perfect for organizing online events, meetings, or get-togethers with participants from different parts of the world.

## How It Works
- **Enter Event Details**: Simply select the date and time for your event and add a description.
- **Automatic Time Conversion**: When you post your schedule on Discord, the event times will be displayed in the timezone of each viewer. This is powered by Discord's timestamp feature, ensuring everyone sees the correct local time.
- **UK Date Format**: While you enter dates in UK format, Discord users will see them in their preferred format, based on their operating system settings.
